# Introduction

The move towards open science and open research practices has increased the demand for the publication of more artifacts of the research process [@sefton_blog_post_2021]. This is particularly apparent in domains that rely on computational experiments, for example, the publication of software, datasets and records of the dependencies that such experiments rely on []. 

It is often argued that the publication of these assets and specifically software [@doi:10.3233/DS-190026] and data should follow the The FAIR principles [@doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18], namely, that they are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. These principles are agnostic to the _implementation_ strategy needed to meet them. Hence, there has been an increasing amount of work in the development of systems and specifications that aim to fulfil these goals []. Data publication with rich metadata (Zenodo) [], domain specific data deposit (PDB) [], following practices for reproducible research software [] (e.g. use of containers) are important examples. 

These strategies are focused primarily on one _type_ of artifact. To address this, \citet{doi:10.1016/j.future.2011.08.004} introduced the notion of a **research object** – _semantically rich aggregations of (potentially distributed) resources that provide a layer of structure on top of information delivered as Linked Data_. A research object combines the ability to document multiple of types of artifacts together, for example, CSV files, code, examples, and figures. This provides a compelling vision as an approach for implementing FAIR. However, existing research object implementations require a large technology stack, were tailored to a particular platform and were also not easily usable for end-users. 

To address this gap, a new community came together [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.3250687] to develop **RO-Crate** - a _lightweight approach to packaging and aggregating research artifacts with their metadata_. The aim of this paper is to introduce RO-Crate and assess it as a strategy for making multiple types of research artifacts FAIR.  Specifically, the contributions of this paper are as follows:

1. an introduction to RO-Crate, its purpose and context;
2. a guide to the RO-Crate community and tooling;
3. and exemplar usage of RO-Crate for different artifacts and its use as a connective tissue for such artifacts.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We first describe RO-Crate, the assumptions underlying it, and define RO-Crate technically and formally. We then proceed to introduce the community and tooling. We then analyze RO-Crate with respect to usage in a diverse set of domains. Finally, we present related work and conclude.
