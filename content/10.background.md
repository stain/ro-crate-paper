# Introduction


The move towards open science and open research practices has increased the demand for the publication of more artefacts of the research process [@sefton_blog_post_2021]. This is particularly apparent in domains that rely on computational experiments; for example, the publication of software, datasets and records of the dependencies that such experiments rely on [@doi:10.1126/science.aah6168]. 

It is often argued that the publication of these assets, and specifically software [@doi:10.3233/DS-190026] and data, should follow the The FAIR principles [@doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18]; namely, that they are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. These principles are agnostic to the _implementation_ strategy needed to comply with them. Hence, there has been an increasing amount of work in the development of systems and specifications that aim to fulfil these goals [@isbn:9781315351148]. Important examples include data publication with rich metadata (e.g. Zenodo [@doi:10.3897/biss.3.37080]), domain specific data deposition (e.g. PDB [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkl971]) and following practices for reproducible research software [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285] (e.g. use of containers). 

These strategies are focused primarily on one _type_ of artefact. To address this, [@doi:10.1016/j.future.2011.08.004] introduced the notion of **research objects** â€“ _semantically rich aggregations of (potentially distributed) resources that provide a layer of structure on top of information delivered in a machine-readable format_. A research object combines the ability to bundle multiple types of artefacts together; for example, CSV files, code, examples, and figures. This provides a compelling vision as an approach for implementing FAIR. However, existing research object implementations require a large technology stack, are tailored to a particular platform and are also not easily usable by end-users. 

To address this gap, a new community came together [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.3250687] to develop **RO-Crate** - an _approach to packaging and aggregating research artefacts with their metadata_. The aim of this paper is to introduce RO-Crate and assess it as a strategy for making multiple types of research artefacts FAIR.  Specifically, the contributions of this paper are as follows:

1. an introduction to RO-Crate, its purpose and context;
2. a guide to the RO-Crate community and tooling;
3. and an exemplar usage of RO-Crate for different artefacts in different communities as well as its use as a connective tissue for such artefacts.

The rest of this paper is organised as follows. We first describe RO-Crate, the assumptions underlying it, and define RO-Crate technically and formally. We then proceed to introduce the community and tooling. We move to analyse RO-Crate with respect to usage in a diverse set of domains. Finally, we present related work and conclude with some remarks including RO-Crate highlights and future work.
