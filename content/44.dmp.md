## Machine-actionable Data Management Plans

Machine-actionable Data Management Plans (maDMPs) have been proposed as an improvement to automate FAIR data management tasks in research [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006750], e.g. by using PIDs and controlled vocabularies to describe what happens to data over the research lifecycle. The Research Data Alliance's _DMP Common Standard_ for maDMPs [@doi:10.15497/rda00039] is one such formalisation for expressing maDMPs, which can be expressed as Linked Data using the DMP Common Standard Ontology [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.3944464], a specializaton W3C DCAT [@dcat2]. However, more commonly, RDA maDMPs are expressed using regular JSON, conforming to the DMP JSON Schema.

A mapping has been produced between Research Object Crates and such Machine-actionable Data Management Plans [@doi:10.4126/frl01-006423291], implemented by the RO-Crate {RDA maDMP Mapper [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.3922136]. A similar mapping has been implemented by Ro-Crate_2_ma-DMP [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.3903463]. In both cases, a maDMP can be converted to a RO-Crate, or vice versa. In [@doi:10.4126/frl01-006423291] this functionality caters for two use cases:

1. Start a skeleton data management plan based on an existing RO-Crate dataset, e.g. from an RO-Crate from Workflow Hub
2. Instantiate an RO-Crate based on a data management plan.

An important difference here is that data management plans are (ideally) written in advance of data production, while RO-Crates are typically created to describe data after it has been generated. This approach shows the importance of _templating_ to make both tasks more automatable and achievable, and how RO-Crate can fit into earlier stages of the research life cycle.
