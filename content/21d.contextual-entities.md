### Data Entities are described using Contextual Entities

RO-Crate distinguishes between [data and contextual entities](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/contextual-entities.html#contextual-vs-data-entities) in a similar way to HTTP terminology's early attempt to separate _information_ (data) and _non-information_ (contextual) resources [@httprange14]. Data entities are usually files and directories located by relative IRI references within the RO-Crate Root, but they can also be Web resources or restricted data identified with absolute IRIs.

As both types of entities are identified by IRIs, their distinction is allowed to be blurry; data entities can be located anywhere and be complex, while contextual entities can have a Web presence beyond their description inside the RO-Crate. For instance `https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097` is primarily an identifier for a person, but secondarily it is also a web page and a way to refer to their academic work. It follows that an RO-Crate should include a contextual entity that describes that person. 

Any particular IRI might appear as a contextual entity in one RO-Crate and as a data entity in another; their distinction lies in the fact that data entities can be considered to be _contained_ or captured by the RO-Crate, while contextual entities mainly _explain_ the RO-Crate and its entities. 

Figure \ref{fig:uml} shows a UML view of RO-Crate, highlighting the different types of data entities and contextual entities that can be aggregated and related. While an RO-Crate would usually contain one or more data entities (`hasPart`), it may also be a pure aggregation of contextual entities (`mentions`).
