### Data Entities are described using Contextual Entities

RO-Crate distinguishes between [data and contextual entities](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/contextual-entities.html#contextual-vs-data-entities) in a similar way to HTTP terminology's early attempt to separate _information_ (data) and _non-information_ (contextual) resources [@httprange14]. Data entities are usually files and directories located by relative IRI references within the RO-Crate Root, but they can also be Web resources or restricted data identified with absolute IRIs, including _Persistent Identifiers_ (PIDs) [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2001414].

As both types of entities are identified by IRIs, their distinction is allowed to be blurry; data entities can be located anywhere and be complex, while contextual entities can have a Web presence beyond their description inside the RO-Crate. For instance `https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097` is primarily an identifier for a person, but secondarily it is also a web page and a way to refer to their academic work. 

Any particular IRI might appear as a contextual entity in one RO-Crate and as a data entity in another; their distinction lies in the fact that data entities can be considered to be _contained_ or captured by the RO-Crate (_RO Content_ in Figure \ref{fig:conceptual}), while contextual entities mainly _explain_ the RO-Crate (although this distinction is not a formal requirement).

In RO-Crate, a referenced contextual entity (e.g. a person identified by ORCID) should always be described within the RO-Crate Metadata File with at least a _type_ and _name_, even where their PID might resolve to further Linked Data. This is so that clients are not required to follow every link for presentation purposes, for instance HTML rendering. Similarly any imported [extension terms](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/appendix/jsonld.html#extending-ro-crate) would themselves also have a human-readable description in the case where their PID does not resolve to human-readable documentation. 

Figure \ref{fig:uml} shows a simplified UML class diagram of RO-Crate, highlighting the different types of data entities and contextual entities that can be aggregated and related. While an RO-Crate would usually contain one or more data entities (`hasPart`), it may also be a pure aggregation of contextual entities (`mentions`).
