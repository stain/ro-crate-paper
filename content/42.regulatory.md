[BioCompute Objects](https://www.biocomputeobject.org/) (BCO) [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000099] is a community-led effort to standardise submissions of computational workflows to biomedical regulators. For instance, a genomics sequencing pipeline, as part of a personalised cancer treatment study, can be submitted to the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) for approval. BCOs are formalised in the standard IEEE 2791-2020 [@doi:10.1109/IEEESTD.2020.9094416] as a combination of [JSON Schemas](https://opensource.ieee.org/2791-object/ieee-2791-schema/) that define the structure of JSON metadata files describing exemplar workflow runs in detail, covering aspects such as the usability and error domain of the workflow, its runtime requirements, the reference datasets used and representative output data produced.

BCOs provide a structured view over a particular workflow, informing regulators about its workings independently of the underlying workflow definition language. However,  BCOs have only limited support for additional metadata. For instance, while the BCO itself can indicate authors and contributors, and in particular regulators and their review decisions, it cannot describe the provenance of individual data files or workflow definitions. 

As a custom JSON format, BCOs cannot be extended with Linked Data concepts, except by adding an additional top-level JSON object formalised in another JSON Schema. A BCO and workflow submitted by upload to a regulator will also frequently consist of multiple cross-related files. Crucially, there is no way to tell whether a given `*.json` file is a BCO file, except by reading its content and check for its `spec_version`. 

We can then consider how a BCO and its referenced artefacts can be packaged and transferred following FAIR principles. [BCO RO-Crate](https://biocompute-objects.github.io/bco-ro-crate/), part of the BioCompute Object user guides, defines a set of best practices for wrapping a BCO within a workflow, together with its exemplar outputs in an RO-Crate, which then provides typing and additional provenance metadata of the individual files, workflow definition, referenced data and the BCO metadata itself. While the BCO remains rigid, the RO-Crate is more open-ended and can therefore also describe other files in the submission not directly related to the BCO, such as further workflow documentation.

While there is some overlap in that RO-Crate can also describe a computational workflow, as detailed in previous sections, a _separation of concerns_ emerges, where the BCO is responsible for describing the inside of a workflow and its run at an abstraction level suitable for a domain scientist, while the RO-Crate describes the surroundings of the workflow, classifying and relating its resources and providing provenance of their existence beyond the BCO. 

A similar separation of concerns can be found within the RO-Crate itself, where the transport-level metadata, such as checksum of files, are [delegated to BagIt](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/appendix/implementation-notes.html#adding-ro-crate-to-bagit) manifests, a standard focusing on the preservation challenges of digital libraries[@doi:10.17487/rfc8493]. As such, RO-Crates are not required to list all the files in their folder hierarchy, but only those that are deemed to be need a description.

Specifically, a BCO alone is insufficient for reliable re-execution of a workflow, which would need a compatible workflow engine depending on the workflow definition language, so IEEE 2791 recommends using Common Workflow Language [@arxiv:2105.07028] for interoperable pipeline execution. CWL itself relies on tool packaging in software containers using Docker or Conda. Thus, we can consider BCO-RO-Crate as a stack consisting of transport-level manifests of files (BagIt), provenance, typing and context of those files (RO-Crate), workflow overview and purpose (BCO), interoperable workflow definition (CWL) and tool distribution (Docker).

BioCompute Object (IEEE2791) is a JSON file that structurally explains the purpose and implementation of a computational workflow, for instance implemented in Nextflow, that installs the workflow’s software dependencies as Docker containers or BioConda packages. An example execution of the workflow shows the different kinds of result outputs, which may be external, using GitHub LFS to support larger data. RO-Crate gathers all these local and external resources, relating them and giving individual descriptions, for instance permanent DOI identifiers for reused datasets accessed from Zenodo, but also adding external identifiers to attribute authors using ORCID or to identify which licences apply to individual resources. The RO-Crate and its local files are captured in a BagIt whose checksum ensures completeness, combined with Big Data Bag \cite{doi:10.1109/BigData.2016.7840618} features to “complete” the bag with large external files such as the workflow outputs")
