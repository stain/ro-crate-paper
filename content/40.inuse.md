# Using RO-Crate

RO-Crate is fundamentally an infrastructure to help make FAIR research artefacts. In other words, the key question is whether RO-Crate can be used to share and (re)use research artefacts. Here we look at three research domains where it is being applied: Bioinformatics, Regulatory Science and Cultural Heritages. In addition we note how RO-Crate can have an importeant role as part of machine-actionable data management plans.
