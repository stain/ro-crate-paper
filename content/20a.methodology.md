## Development Methodology {#methodology}

\label{sec:methodology}

It is a good question as to what base level we assume for ‘conceptually simple’. We take simplicity to apply at two levels: for the _developers_ who produce the platforms and for the _data practitioners_ and users of those platforms. 

For our development methodology we followed the mantra of working closely with a small group to really get a deep understanding of requirements and ensure rapid feedback loops. We created a pool of early adopter projects from a range of disciplines and groups, primarily addressing developers of platforms. Thus the base level for simplicity was **developer friendliness**. 

We assumed a developer familiar with making Web applications with JSON data (who would then learn how to make _RO-Crate JSON-LD_), which informed core design choices for our JSON-level documentation approach and RO-Crate serialization (section \ref{sec:implementation}). Our group of early adopters, growing as the community evolved, drove the RO-Crate requirements and provided feedback through our multiple communication channels including bi-monthly meetings, which we describe in Section \ref{sec:community}. 

Addressing the simplicity of understanding and engaging with RO-Crate by data practitioners is through the platforms, for example with interactive tools  (section \ref{sec:tooling}) like [Describo](https://uts-eresearch.github.io/describo/) [@describo] and  Jupyter notebooks [@doi:10.3233/978-1-61499-649-1-87], and by close discussions with domain scientists on how to appropriately capture what they determine to be relevant metadata. This ultimately requires a new type of awareness and learning material separate from developer specifications, focusing on the simplicity of extensibility to serve the user needs, along with user-driven development of new RO-Crate Profiles specific for their needs (section \ref{sec:inuse}).
