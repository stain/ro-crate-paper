\label{sec:recommendedpractices}

RO-Crate as a specification aims to build a set of recommended practices on how to practically apply existing standards in a common way to describe research outputs and their provenance, without having to learn each of the underlying technologies in detail.

As such, the [RO-Crate 1.1](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1) specification [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.4541002] can be seen as an opinionated and example-driven guide to writing [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) [@doi:10.1145/2857274.2857276] metadata as JSON-LD [@sporny_2014], which leaves it open for implementers to include additional metadata using other Schema.org types and properties, or even additional Linked Data vocabularies/ontologies or their own ad-hoc terms.

However the primary purpose of the RO-Crate specification is to assist developers in leveraging Linked Data principles for the focused purpose of describing Research Objects in a structured language, while reducing the steep learning curve otherwise involved in Semantic Web adaptation, like ontology development and selection, identifiers, namespaces, and RDF serialization choices.
