### Ensuring Simplicity {#simplicity}

\label{sec:implicitly}

One aim of RO-Crate is to be conceptually simple. This simplicity has been repeatedly checked and confirmed through an informal community review process. For instance, in the discussion on supporting [ad-hoc vocabularies](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/71) in RO-Crate, the community explored potential Linked Data solutions. The conventional wisdom in [RDF best practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-vocab-pub/) is to establish a vocabulary with a new URI namespace, formalised using [RDF Schema](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf-schema-20140225/) or [OWL](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-overview-20121211/) ontologies. However, this may seem an excessive learning curve for non-experts in semantic knowledge representation, and the RO-Crate community instead agreed on a dual lightweight approach: (i) [Document](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/appendix/jsonld.html#adding-new-or-ad-hoc-vocabulary-terms) how projects with their own Web-presence can make a pure HTML-based vocabulary, and (ii) provide a community-wide PID namespace under `https://w3id.org/ro/terms` that redirect to simple CSV files [maintained in GitHub](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-terms). 

To further verify this idea of simplicity, we have formalised the RO-Crate definition (see _Appendix A_). An important result of this exercise is that the underlying data structure of RO-Crate, although conceptually a graph, is represented as a depth-limited tree. This formalisation also emphasises the _boundedness_ of the structure; namely, the fact that elements are specifically identified as being either semantically _contained_ by the RO-Crate as _Data Entities_ (`hasPart`) or mainly referenced (`mentions`) and typed as _external_ to the Research Object as _Contextual Entities_.  It is worth pointing out that this semantic containment can extend beyond the physical containment of files residing within the RO-Crate Root directory on a given storage system, as the RO-Crate data entities may include any data resource globally identifiable using IRIs.
