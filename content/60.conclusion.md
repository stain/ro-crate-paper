# Conclusion

RO-Crate provides a lightweight approach to packaging digital research artifacts with structured metadata, assisting developers and researchers to produce and consume FAIR data archives of their Research Objects, including permanent identifiers, contextualization and provenance of research items. Aggregated data may be large and distributed, or regular folders on a file system. 

As a set of Best Practice recommendations, developed by an open and broad community, RO-Crate shows how to use "just enough" Linked Data standards in a consistent way, with structured metadata using a rich base vocabulary that can cover everyday contextual relations, however also extensible for domain- and application-specific details. 

Supported by multiple open source tools and libraries, RO-Crate fit into the larger landscape of open scholarly communication and FAIR Digital Object infrastructure, easily integrated into data repository platforms. RO-Crate can be applied as a data/metadata exchange mechanism, assist in long-term archival preservation of metadata and data, or simply used at small-scale by individual researchers.
