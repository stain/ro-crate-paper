# Conclusion

RO-Crate provides an approach to packaging digital research artefacts with structured metadata, assisting developers and researchers to produce and consume FAIR archives of their research. 

As a set of best practice recommendations, developed by an open and broad community, RO-Crate shows how to use "just enough" Linked Data standards in a consistent way, with structured metadata using a rich base vocabulary that can cover general-purpose contextual relations, whilst retaining extensibility to domain- and application-specific uses.  

The adoption of simple web technologies in the RO-Crate specification has helped a rapid development of a wide variety of supporting open source tools and libraries. RO-Crate fits into the larger landscape of open scholarly communication and FAIR Digital Object infrastructure, and can be  integrated into data repository platforms. RO-Crate can be applied as a data/metadata exchange mechanism, assist in long-term archival preservation of metadata and data, or simply used at small-scale by individual researchers. Thanks to its strong community support, new and improved profiles and tools are continuously added to the RO-Crate tooling landscape, making it easier for adopters to find examples and support for their own use case.
