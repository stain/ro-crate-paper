RO-Crate provides an approach to packaging digital research artefacts with structured metadata. This approach assists developers and researchers to produce and consume FAIR archives of their research. 

RO-Crate is formed by a set of best practice recommendations, developed by an open and broad community. These guidelines show how to use "just enough" Linked Data standards in a consistent way. The use of structured metadata with a rich base vocabulary can cover general-purpose contextual relations, with a Linked Data foundation that ensures extensibility to domain- and application-specific uses.  

The adoption of simple Web technologies in the RO-Crate specification has helped a rapid development of a wide variety of supporting open source tools and libraries. RO-Crate fits into the larger landscape of open scholarly communication and FAIR Digital Object infrastructure, and can be integrated into data repository platforms. RO-Crate can be applied as a data/metadata exchange mechanism, assist in long-term archival preservation of metadata and data, or simply used at a small scale by individual researchers. Thanks to its strong community support, new and improved profiles and tools are being continuously added to the RO-Crate tooling landscape, making it easier for adopters to find examples and support for their own use case.
