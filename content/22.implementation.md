## Technical implementation of the model

The above conceptual model has been realised using JSON-LD and schema.org in a prescriptive form as discussed in the best practice approach. This technical approach again caters for simplicity. 

[JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) provides a way to express Linked Data as a JSON structure, where a _context_ provides mapping to RDF properties and classes. While JSON-LD can’t map arbitrary JSON structure to RDF, we found it does provide a good starting point for making a JSON-based language that is also interpretable as Linked Data.

In the design of RO-Crate we did however find that JSON-LD alone, like many RDF technologies, has too many degrees of freedom and hidden complexities for software developers to reliably produce and consume without specialized expertise or software libraries.  A large part of the RO-Crate specification is therefore dedicated to describing JSON structures. 

### RO-Crate JSON-LD

RO-Crate mandates the use of [flattened, compacted JSON-LD](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/appendix/jsonld.html) where a single `@graph` array contains all the data and contextual entities in a flat list:

```json
{ "@context": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1/context",
  "@graph": [
    { "@id": "ro-crate-metadata.json",      
      "@type": "CreativeWork",
      "about": {"@id": "./"},
    },
    { "@id": "./",
      "@type": "Dataset",
      "hasPart": [
        {"@id": "data1.txt"},
        {"@id": "data2.txt"}
      ]
    },
    { "@id": "data1.txt",
      "@type": "File",
      "author": {"@id": "#alice"},
    },
    { "@id": "data2.txt",
      "@type": "File",
      "author": {"@id": "#alice"},
    },
    { "@id": "#alice",
      "@type": "Person",
      "name": "Alice",
    },
    { "@id": "http://sws.geonames.org/8152662/",
      "@type": "Place",
      "name": "Catalina Park"
    }
] }
```

It can be argued that this is a more graph-like approach than the tree structure JSON would otherwise invite, and which is normally emphasised as a feature of JSON-LD in order to “hide” its RDF nature. 

However, we found that the use of trees for, say,\emph{ a _Person_ entity appearing as author of a _File_ which nests under a _Dataset, _hasPart_}, counter-intuitively leads one to consider the JSON-LD as an RDF Graph, as an identified Person entity can then appear at multiple and repeated points of the tree (e.g. author of multiple files), necessitating node merging or duplication. 

By comparison, a single flat `@graph` array approach means that applications can process and edit each entity as pure JSON by a simple lookup based on `@id`. At the same time, lifting all entities to the same level emphasizes Research Object's principle that describing the context and provenance is just as important as describing the data.

While RO-Crate mainly uses schema.org, we found that JSON-based RO-Crate applications that are largely unaware of JSON-LD still may want to process the `@context` to find Linked Data definitions of unknown properties and types. Thus, RO-Crate provides its own versioned JSON-LD context, which has a similar flat list with the mapping from JSON-LD keys to their URI equivalents; for instance, `author` maps to [http://schema.org/author](http://schema.org/author). Not reusing the official schema.org context means RO-Crate is also able to map in additional vocabularies where needed, namely the _Portland Common Data Model_ (PCDM) [@pcdm] for repositories and Bioschemas [@bioschemas_2017] for describing computational workflows.

Similarly, rather than relying on implications from `"@type: @id"` annotations in the context, RO-Crate JSON-LD distinguishes explicitly between references to other entities (`{"id": "#alice"}`) and string values (`"Alice"`) - meaning RO-Crate applications can find the corresponding entity without parsing the `@context`.
