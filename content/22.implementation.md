## Technical implementation of the RO-Crate model

The RO-Crate conceptual model has been realised using JSON-LD and Schema.org in a prescriptive form as discussed in the previous sections. These technical choices were made to caters for simplicity. 

[JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) [@sporny_2014] provides a way to express Linked Data as a JSON structure, where a _context_ provides mapping to RDF properties and classes. While JSON-LD cannot map arbitrary JSON structures to RDF, we found it does lower the barrier as it follows a JSON structure, nowadays a common and popular format for data exchange on the Web.

However, JSON-LD alone has too many degrees of freedom and hidden complexities for software developers to reliably produce and consume without specialised expertise or large RDF software frameworks.  A large part of the RO-Crate specification is therefore dedicated to describing JSON structures. 

### RO-Crate JSON-LD

RO-Crate mandates the use of [flattened, compacted JSON-LD](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/appendix/jsonld.html) in the RO-Crate Metadata file `ro-crate-metadata.json`[^4] where a single `@graph` array contains all the data and contextual entities in a flat list. An example can be seen in the JSON-LD snippet in listing 1 below, describing a simple RO-Crate containing two datasets (data1.txt and data2.txt):


```json
{ "@context": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1/context",
  "@graph": [
    { "@id": "ro-crate-metadata.json",      
      "@type": "CreativeWork",
      "conformsTo": {"@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1"},
      "about": {"@id": "./"}
    },

    },

    },

_Listing 1_: _Simplified[^5] RO-Crate metadata file showing the flattened compacted JSON-LD `@graph` array containing the data entities and contextual entities, cross-referenced using @id. The ro-crate-metadata.json entity declares conformance with the RO-Crate specification using a versioned persistent identifier, further RO-Crate descriptions are on the root data entity ./ or any of the referenced data or contextual entities, as exemplified by the ImageObject referencing contextual entities for contentLocation and author that differs from that of the overall RO-Crate.  While  Person entities ideally are identified with ORCID PIDs as for Josiah, in contrast #alice is here an RO-Crate local identifier, highlighting the pragmatic “just enough” Linked Data approach_

In this flattened profile of JSON-LD, each `{entity}` under `@graph` represents the RDF triples with a common subject (`@id`), mapped properties like `hasPart`, and objects - as either literal `"string"` values, referenced `{objects}` (which properties are listed in its own entity), or a JSON `[list]` of these.  If processed as JSON-LD, this forms an RDF graph by matching the `@id` IRIs and applying the `@context` mapping to schema.org terms. 

#### Flattened JSON-LD

When JSON-LD 1.0 [@sporny_2014] was proposed, one of the motivations was to seamlessly apply an RDF nature on top of regular JSON as frequently used by Web APIs. JSON objects in APIs are frequently nested with objects at multiple levels, and the perhaps most common form of JSON-LD is the [compacted form](https://json-ld.org/spec/REC/json-ld/20140116/#compacted-document-form) which follows this expectation ([JSON-LD 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/REC-json-ld11-20200716/) further expands these capabilities, e.g. allowing nested `@context` definitions).  

While this feature of JSON-LD can be see as a way to “hide” its RDF nature, we found that the use of nested trees (e.g. a `Person` entity appearing as `author` of a `File` which nests under a `Dataset` with `hasPart`) counter-intuitively forces consumers to consider the JSON-LD as an RDF Graph, since an identified `Person` entity can appear at multiple and repeated points of the tree (e.g. author of multiple files), necessitating node merging or duplication, which can become complicated as this approach also invites the use of _blank nodes_ (entities missing `@id`). 

By comparison, a single flat `@graph` array approach as preferred by RO-Crate means that applications can process and edit each entity as pure JSON by a simple lookup based on `@id`. At the same time, lifting all entities to the same level emphasises the principle that describing the context and provenance is just as important as describing the data, and the requirement of `@id` of every entity forces RO-Crate generators to consciously [consider existing IRIs and identifiers](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/appendix/jsonld.html#describing-entities-in-json-ld). 


#### JSON-LD context

In JSON-LD, the `@context` is a reference to another JSON-LD document that provides mapping from JSON keys to Linked Data term IRIs, and can enable various JSON-LD directives to cater for customized JSON structures for translating to RDF.

RO-Crate reuses Schema.org vocabulary terms and IRIs, but provides its own versioned [JSON-LD context](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1/context), which has a flat list with the mapping from JSON-LD keys to their URI equivalents (e.g. `author` maps to [http://schema.org/author](http://schema.org/author)). 

The rationale behind this decision is to support JSON-based RO-Crate applications that are largely unaware of JSON-LD, that still may want to process the `@context` to find or add Linked Data definitions of otherwise unknown properties and types. Not reusing the official Schema.org context means RO-Crate is also able to map in additional vocabularies where needed, namely the _Portland Common Data Model_ (PCDM) [@pcdm] for repositories and Bioschemas [@bioschemas_2017] for describing computational workflows. RO-Crate profiles may [extend](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/appendix/jsonld.html#extending-ro-crate) the `@context` to re-use additional domain-specific ontologies.

Similarly, while the schema.org context has `"@type": "@id"` annotations for object properties, RO-Crate JSON-LD distinguishes explicitly between references to other entities (`{"@id": "#alice"}`) and string values (`"Alice"`) - meaning RO-Crate applications can find references for corresponding entities and IRIs without parsing the `@context` to understand a particular property.  Notably this is exploited by the `ro-crate-html-js` [@ro-crate-html-js] tool to provide reliable HTML rendering for otherwise unknown properties and types.

[^4]: The avid reader may spot that the RO-Crate Metadata file use the extension `.json` instead of `.jsonld`, this is to emphasize the developer expectations as a JSON format, while the file's JSON-LD nature is secondary. 

[^5]: Recommended properties for shown types in Listing 1 also include `description`, `datePublished`, `encodingFormat`, `encodingFormat`, `affiliation`, `contactPoint`, `publisher`, `funder`, `citation`, `identifier`,  `keywords`, `subjectOf`;  these properties and corresponding contextual entities are excluded here for brevity.
