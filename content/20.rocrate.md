# RO-Crate

RO-Crate provides a lightweight approach to packaging research artifacts with their metadata. To illustrate this, let us imagine a research paper reporting on the sequence analysis of proteins in an experiment on mice. The sequence output files, sequence analysis code, and reports summarising statistical measures or outputs are all important and inter-related research outputs, and consequently would all be put in the same directory. This directory, along with the relationships between its constituent resources, is what the RO-Crate model aims to represent. 

The question then arises as to how the directory with all this material should be packaged in a manner that is accessible and usable by others. By usable we mean not just readable by humans but accessible programmatically.  A de facto approach to sharing collections of resources is through compressed archives (e.g. a zip file). This solves the problem of “packaging”, but it does not guarantee downstream access to all resources in a programmatic fashion, or know the role of each file in that particular research. This leads to the need for explicit metadata about the contents of the folder.

Examples of metadata descriptions across a [wide range of domains](https://rdamsc.bath.ac.uk/scheme-index) abound within the literature, both in research data management (?cite) and within library and information systems (?cite). However, many of these approaches require knowledge of metadata schemas, particular annotation systems, or the use of obscure or complex software stacks. Indeed, particularly within research, these requirements have led to a lack of adoption and growing  frustration with current tooling and specifications [@neylon_blog_post_2017].

RO-Crate seeks to address this complexity by:

1. being easy to understand and simple conceptually;
2. providing a strong and opinionated guide to current best practices;
3. adopting software stacks that are widely used on the Web.

In the following sections we show how the RO-Crate specification and ecosystem achieve these goals, which concur in forming our definition of “lightweight”.
