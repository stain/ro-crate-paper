### Extensibility and RO-Crate profiles {#profiles}

\label{sec:profiles}

The RO-Crate specification provides a core set of conventions to describe research outputs using types and properties applicable across scientific domains. However we have found that domain-specific use of RO-Crate will, implicitly or explicitly, form a specialised **profile** of RO-Crate; i.e., _a set of conventions, types and properties that are minimally required and one can expect to be present in that subset of RO-Crates_. For instance, RO-Crates used for exchange of workflows will have to contain a data entity of type `ComputationalWorkflow`, or cultural heritage records should have a `contentLocation`. 

Making such profiles explicit allow further reliable programmatic consumption and generation of RO-Crates beyond the core types defined in the RO-Crate specification. Following the RO-Crate mantra of _guidance over strictness_, profiles are mainly _duck-typing_ rather than strict syntactic or semantic types, but may also have corresponding machine-readable schemas at multiple levels (file formats, JSON, RDF shapes, RDFS/OWL semantics).

The next version of the RO-Crate specification 1.2 will define a [formalization](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.2-DRAFT/profiles) for publishing and declaring conformance to RO-Crate profiles. Such a profile is primarily a human-readable document of before-mentioned expectations and conventions, but may also define a machine-readable profile as a **Profile Crate**: Another RO-Crate that describe the profile and in addition can list schemas for validation, compatible software, applicable repositories, serialization/packaging formats, extension vocabularies, custom JSON-LD contexts and examples (see for example the [Workflow RO-Crate profile](https://w3id.org/workflowhub/workflow-ro-crate/)).

In addition, there are sometimes existing domain-specific metadata formats, but they are either not RDF-based (and thus time-consuming to construct terms for in JSON-LD) or are at a different granularity level that might become overwhelming if represented directly in the RO-Crate Metadata file (e.g. W3C PROV bundle detailing every step execution of a workflow run [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giz095]). RO-Crate allows such _alternative metadata files_ to co-exist, and be described as data entities with references to the standards and vocabularies they conform to. This simplifies further programmatic consumption even where no filename or file extension conventions have emerged for those metadata formats.

Section \ref{sec:inuse} examines the observed specializations of RO-Crate use in several domains and their emerging profiles.
