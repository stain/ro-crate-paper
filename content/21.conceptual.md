## Conceptual Definition

A key premise of RO-Crate is the existence of a wide variety of resources on the Web that can help describe research. As such, RO-Crate relies on concepts from the Web, in particular that of Linked Data. Figure {@fig:conceptual} shows  the main conceptual elements involved in an RO-Crate; the top half shows the metadata elements while the bottom half depicts the artefacts bundled and described by the RO-Crate.

![Conceptual RO-Crate Overview](../content/images/ro-crate-overview.pdf "\textbf{Conceptual overview of RO-Crate}. A \emph{Persistent Identifier} (PID) identifies a \emph{Research Object} (RO), which is archived using BagIt\cite{@doi:10.17487/rfc8493}, OCFL\cite{ocfl_2020}, git or ZIP. The RO is described within a \textit{RO Metadata File}, providing identifiers for authors using ORCID, organisations using ROR and licences such as Creative Commons. The \emph{RO-Crate content} is further described with its own metadata. Data can be embedded files and directories, as well as links to external web resources, PIDs and nested RO-Crates."){#fig:conceptual width="90%"}

### Linked Data as a core principle

Linked Data principles[@doi:10.4018/978-1-60960-593-3.ch008] (use of IRIs to identify resources (i.e. artefacts), resolvable via HTTP, enriched with metadata and linked to each other) are core to RO-Crate; therefore IRIs[^1] are used to identify an RO-Crate package, its constituent parts and metadata descriptions, and the properties and classes used in the metadata. 

Linked Data make it possible for consumers to follow links for more (ideally both human- and machine-readable) information; as the RO-Crate relies on these principles, ti can be sufficiently _self-describing_ as artefacts can be interrelated using global identifiers, without needing to recursively fully describe every referenced artefact.

[PROPOSED REPHRASE ON PREVIOUS PAR] RO Crates are _self-described_; and follow the Linked Data principles to describe all of their resources in both human and machine readable manner.  Hence, resources are identified using global identifiers; and  relationships between two resources are defined with links.

The foundation on Linked Data and shared vocabularies also means multiple RO-Crates and other Linked Data resources can be indexed, combined, queried, integrated or transformed using existing Semantic Web technologies such as SPARQL and knowledge graph triple stores.

### RO-Crate is a self-described container

An RO-Crate is defined as a self-described **Root Data Entity** that describes and contains _data entities_, which are further described using _contextual entities_.  A **data entity** is either a _file_ (i.e. a set of bytes stored on disk somewhere) or a _directory_ (i.e. dataset of named files and other directories) — while a **contextual entity** exists outside the information system (e.g. a Person, a workflow language) and it is defined by its metadata. The representation of a **data entity** as a set of bytes makes it possible to store a variety of research artefacts including not only data but also, for instance, software and text.

The Root Data Entity is a directory, the RO-Crate root, identified by the presence of the **RO-Crate Metadata File** (`ro-crate-metadata.json`). This is a JSON-LD file that describes the RO-Crate, its content and related metadata using Linked Data. JSON-LD is an RDF serialisation that has become popular as it is easy to read by humans while also offers some advantages for data exchange on the Internet (e.g. it removes some of the cross-domain restrictions that can be present with XML). JSON-LD is the preferred and widely supported format by RO-Crate tools and community.

The minimal [requirements for the root data entity metadata](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/root-data-entity.html#direct-properties-of-the-root-data-entity) are `name`, `description` and `datePublished`, as well as a contextual entity identifying its `license` —  additional metadata are frequently added depending on the purpose of the particular RO-Crate.

RO-Crate can be stored, transferred or published in multiple ways, such as BagIt [@doi:10.17487/rfc8493], Oxford Common File Layout [@ocfl_2020] (OCFL), downloadable ZIP archives in Zenodo or through dedicated online repositories, as well as published directly on the Web, e.g. using GitHub Pages. Combined with Linked Data identifiers, this caters for a diverse set of storage and access requirements across different scientific domains, from metagenomics workflows producing hundreds of gigabytes of genome data to cultural heritage records with access restrictions for personally identifiable data.

### Data Entities are described using Contextual Entities

RO-Crate distinguishes between [data and contextual entities](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/contextual-entities.html#contextual-vs-data-entities) in a similar way to HTTP terminology's early attempt to separate _information_ (data) and _non-information_ (contextual) resources [@httprange14]. Data entities are usually files and directories located by relative IRI references within the RO-Crate Root, but they can also be Web or restricted resources identified with absolute IRIs.

As both types of entities are identified by IRIs, their distinction is allowed to be blurry; data entities can be located anywhere and be complex, while contextual entities can have a Web presence beyond their description inside the RO-Crate. For instance `https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097` is primarily an identifier for a person, but secondarily also a web page that describes that person and their academic work. 

Any particular IRI might appear as a contextual entity in one RO-Crate and as a data entity in another; their distinction lies in the fact that data entities can be considered to be _contained_ or captured by the RO-Crate, while contextual entities mainly _explain_ the RO-Crate and its entities. It follows that an RO-Crate should have one or more data entities, although this is not a formal requirement. 

Figure {@fig:uml} shows a UML view of RO-Crate \ref{fig:uml}, highlighting the different types of data entities and contextual entities that can be aggregated and related.

![RO-Crate UML](../content/images/ro-crate-uml.pdf "\textbf{UML model view of RO-Crate.} The \emph{RO-Crate Metadata File} conforms to a version of the specification, which mainly describes the \emph{RO-Crate Root Data Entity} representing the Research Object as a dataset. The RO-Crate aggregates \emph{data entities} (\texttt{hasPart}) which are further described using \emph{contextual entities}. Multiple types and relations from Schema.org allow annotations to be more specific, including figures, nested datasets, computational workflows, people, organisations, instruments and places."){#fig:uml width="90%"}


### Best Practice Guide rather than strict specification

RO-Crate builds on Linked Data standards and community-evolved vocabularies such as JSON-LD [@sporny_2014] and [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) [@guha2015schema], but rather than enforcing additional constraints and limits — using perhaps intimidating technologies such as _RDF shapes_ (SHACL, ShEx) — RO-Crate aims instead to build a set of best practices on how to apply  existing standards in a common way to describe research outputs and their provenance.

As such, the [RO-Crate 1.1](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1) specification [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.4541002] can be seen as an opinionated and example-driven guide to writing Schema.org metadata as JSON-LD, which leaves it open for implementers to include additional metadata using other Schema.org types and properties, or even additional Linked Data vocabularies/ontologies or their own ad-hoc terms.

This does not mean, however, that RO-Crate does not have constraints. Crucially, the specification is quite strict on the JSON-LD being _flattened_ and _compacted_, to facilitate lightweight consumption and generation of the RO-Crate Metadata file without the need for RDF libraries. In addition, work has now begun to formalise different _profiles_ of RO-Crates, which may impose additional constraints based on the needs of a specific domain or use case. For instance, submission to a workflow repository would expect an RO-Crate to contain at least one workflow with a declared licence and workflow language; specific additional recommendations could also be needed to meet the emerging requirements of [FAIR Digital Objects](https://fairdo.org/). These optional profiles are planned to build on a combination of JSON Schemas and RDF shapes, but again these will primarily provide developers with guidance and suggestions rather than strict validation requirements.


### Checking Simplicity

As previously stated, one aim of RO-Crate is to be conceptually simple. This simplicity has been repeatedly checked and confirmed through a community review process. See for example the discussion at ([GitHub issue #71 on ad-hoc vocabularies](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/71)). 

To further verify this idea, we have formalised the RO-Crate definition (see Appendix X). An important result of this exercise is that the underlying data structure of RO-Crate is a depth limited tree of 1 level. The formalisation also emphasises the _boundedness_ of the structure; namely, the fact that elements are specifically identified as being either semantically _contained_ by the RO-Crate (`hasPart`) or mainly referenced (`mentions`) and typed as _external_ to the Research Object (Contextual Entities).
