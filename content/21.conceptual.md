## Conceptual Definition

A key premise of RO-Crate is the existence of a wide variety of resources on the Web that can help describe research. As such RO-Crate relies on concepts from the Web and in particular linked data. 

![Conceptual RO-Crate Overview](../content/images/ro-crate-overview.pdf "\textbf{Conceptual overview of RO-Crate}. A \emph{Permanent Identifier} (PID) identifies a \emph{Research Object} (RO), which is archived using BagIt\cite{@doi:10.17487/rfc8493}, OCFL\cite{ocfl_2020}, git or ZIP. Using Linked Data, the RO is described within an \textit{RO Metadata File}, providing identifiers for authors using ORCID, organizations using ROR and licenses such as Creative Commons. The \emph{RO-Crate content} is further described with their own metadata. Data can be embedded files and directories, as well as links to external web resources, PIDs and nested RO-Crates."){#fig:conceptual width="90%"}

### Linked Data as a core principle

Linked Data [@doi:10.4018/978-1-60960-593-3.ch008] is a core principle of RO-Crate, and IRIs[^1] are therefore used to identify the RO-Crate, its constituent parts and metadata descriptions, as well as the properties and classes used in the metadata. 

Using Linked Data, where consumers can follow the links for more (ideally both human- or machine-readable) information, the RO-Crate can then be sufficiently _self-described_ and related using global identifiers, without needing to recursively fully describe every referenced entity.

The base of Linked Data and shared vocabularies also means multiple RO-Crates and other Linked Data resources can be indexed, combined, queried, integrated or transformed using existing Semantic Web technologies like SPARQL and knowledge graph triple stores.

### RO-Crate is a self-described container

An RO-Crate is defined as a self-described **Root Data Entity**, which describes and contains _data entities_, which are further described using _contextual entities_.  A **data entity** is primarily a _file_ (bytes on disk somewhere) or a _directory_ (dataset of named files) — while a **contextual entity** exists outside the information system (e.g. a Person) and its bytes are primarily metadata.

The _Root Data Entity_ is a directory, the _RO-Crate Root_, identified by the presence of the **RO-Crate Metadata File** with the fixed name `ro-crate-metadata.json`. This is a JSON-LD file that describes the RO-Crate, its content and related metadata using Linked Data. 

The minimal [requirements for the root data entity metadata](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/root-data-entity.html#direct-properties-of-the-root-data-entity) are `name`, `description` and `datePublished`, as well as a contextual entity identifying its `license` —  additional metadata is frequently added depending on the purpose of the particular RO-Crate.

Because the RO-Crate is just a set of related resources and datasets, it can be stored, transferred or published in multiple ways, such as BagIt [@doi:10.17487/rfc8493], Oxford Common File Layout [@ocfl_2020] (OCFL), downloadable ZIP archives in Zenodo or dedicated online repositories, as well as published directly on the web, e.g. using GitHub Pages. Combined with Linked Data identifiers, this caters for a diverse set of storage and access requirements across different scientific domains, e.g. metagenomics workflows producing ~100 GB of genome data, or cultural heritage records with access restrictions for personally identifiable data.

### Data Entities are described using Contextual Entities

RO-Crate distinguishes between [data and contextual entities](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/contextual-entities.html#contextual-vs-data-entities) in a similar way to HTTP terminology's early attempt to separate _information_ (data) and _non-information_ (contextual) resource [@httprange14]. While the data entities in the most common scenario are files and directories located by relative IRI references within the RO-Crate Root, they can also be web resources identified with absolute http/https IRIs.

As both types of entities are identified by IRIs, their distinction is allowed to be blurry; data entities can be located anywhere and be complex, and contextual entities can have a Web presence beyond their description inside the RO-Crate. For instance `https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097` is primarily an identifier for a person, but is secondarily also a web page that describes that person and their academic work. 

Any particular IRI might appear as a contextual entity in one RO-Crate, and a data entity in another; their distinction is that data entities can be considered to be _contained_ or captured by the RO-Crate, while the contextual entities are mainly _explaining_ the RO-Crate and its entities. It follows that an RO-Crate should have one or more data entities, although this is not a formal requirement. 

Figure {@fig:uml} shows a UML view of RO-Crate \ref{fig:uml}, highlighting the different types of data entities and contextual entities that can be aggregated and related.

![RO-Crate UML](../content/images/ro-crate-uml.pdf "\textbf{UML model view of RO-Crate.} The \emph{RO-Crate Metadata File} conforms to a version of the specification, which mainly describes the \emph{RO-Crate Root Data Entity} representing the Research Object as a dataset. The RO-Crate aggregates \emph{data entities} (\texttt{hasPart}) which are further described using \emph{contextual entities}. Multiple types and relations from schema.org allow annotations to be more specific, including figures, nested datasets, computational workflows, people, organizations, instruments and places."){#fig:uml width="90%"}


### Best Practice Guide rather than strict specification

RO-Crate builds on Linked Data standards and community-evolved vocabularies like JSON-LD [@sporny_2014] and [schema.org](https://schema.org/), but rather than enforce additional constraints and limits using perhaps intimidating technologies like _RDF shapes_ (SHACL, ShEx), RO-Crate aims instead to build a set of best practice guides on how to apply the existing standards in a common way to describe research outputs and their provenance.

As such, the specification [RO-Crate 1.1](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1) [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.4541002] can be seen as an opinionated and example-driven guide to writing schema.org metadata as JSON-LD, which leaves it open for implementers to add additional metadata using other schema.org types and properties, or even additional Linked Data vocabularies/ontologies or their own ad-hoc terms.

This does not mean, however, that RO-Crate does not have constraints. Crucially, the specification is quite strict on the style of the flattened JSON-LD to facilitate lightweight developer consumption and generation of the RO-Crate Metadata file without the need for RDF libraries. In addition, work has now begun to formalize different _profiles_ of RO-Crates, which may impose additional constraints based on the needs of a specific domain or use case. For instance, submission to a workflow repository would expect an RO-Crate with at least one workflow with a declared license and workflow language; specific additional recommendations could also be needed to meet the emerging requirements of [FAIR Digital Objects](https://fairdo.org/). These optional profiles are planned to build on a combination of JSON Schemas and RDF shapes, but again these will primarily provide developers with guidance and suggestions rather than strict validation.


### Checking Simplicity

As previously discussed, one aim of RO-Crate is to be conceptually simple. This simplicity has been repeatedly checked and confirmed through a community process. See for example the discussion at ([GitHub issue #71 on ad-hoc vocabularies](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/71)). 

To further verify this idea, we have here formalized the RO-Crate definition (see Appendix X). An important result of this exercise is that the underlying data structure of RO-Crate is a depth limited tree of 1 level. The formalization also emphasizes the _boundness_ of the structure; namely, that elements are specifically identified as being either semantically _contained_ by the RO-Crate (`hasPart`), or are mainly referenced (`mentions`) and typed as _external_ to the Research Object (Contextual Entities).
