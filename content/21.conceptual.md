## Conceptual Definition

A key premise of RO-Crate is the existence of a wide variety of resources on the Web that can help describe research. As such, RO-Crate relies on the Linked Data principles [@doi:10.2200/S00334ED1V01Y201102WBE001]. Figure \ref{fig:conceptual} shows the main conceptual elements involved in an RO-Crate: an RO-Metadata File (top) describes the research object using structured metadata including external references, coupled with the contained artefacts (bottom) bundled and described by the RO-Crate.

    \caption{\textbf{Conceptual overview of RO-Crate}. A \emph{Persistent Identifier} (PID) \cite{doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2001414} points to a \emph{Research Object} (RO), which may be archived using different packaging approaches like BagIt \cite{doi:10.17487/rfc8493}, OCFL \cite{ocfl_2020}, git or ZIP. The RO is described within a \emph{RO-Crate Metadata File}, providing identifiers for \emph{authors} using ORCID, \emph{organisations} using [ROR](https://ror.org/) and licences such as Creative Commons using SPDX identifiers. The \emph{RO-Crate content} is further described with additional metadata. Data can be embedded files and directories, as well as links to external web resources, PIDs and nested RO-Crates.}
