## Conceptual Definition

A key premise of RO-Crate is the existence of a wide variety of resources on the Web that can help describe research. As such, RO-Crate relies on the Linked Data principles [@doi:10.2200/S00334ED1V01Y201102WBE001]. Figure \ref{fig:conceptual} shows the main conceptual elements involved in an RO-Crate: An RO-Metadata File (top) describes the research object using structured metadata including external references, coupled with the contained artefacts (bottom) bundled and described by the RO-Crate.
