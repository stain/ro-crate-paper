With the increasing digitisation of research processes, there has been a significant call for the wider adoption of interoperable sharing of data and its associated metadata. For a comprehensive overview and recommendations, in particular for data, we refer to [@doi:10.1016/j.patter.2020.100136], which highlights the wide variety of metadata and documentation that the literature prescribes for enabling data reuse. 

Here we focus on approaches for bundling research artefacts along with their metadata. This notion of publishing compound objects for scholarly communication has a long history behind it [@doi:10.1190/1.1822162] [@vandesompel_2007], but recent approaches have followed three main strands: 1) publishing to centralised repositories; 2) packaging approaches similar to RO-Crate; and 3) bundling the computational workflow around a scientific experiment.

## Bundling and Packaging Digital Research Artefacts

The challenge of describing computational workflows was one of the main motivations for the early proposal of _Research Objects_ (RO) [@doi:10.1016/j.future.2011.08.004] as first-class citizens for sharing and publishing. The RO approach involves bundling datasets, workflows, scripts and results along with traditional dissemination materials like journal articles and presentations, forming a single package. Crucially, these resources are not just gathered, but also individually typed, described and related to each other using semantic vocabularies. As pointed out in [@doi:10.1016/j.future.2011.08.004] an open-ended _Linked Data_ approach is not sufficient for scholarly communication: a common data model is also needed in addition to common and best practices for managing and annotating lifecycle, ownership, versioning and attributions.

Considering the FAIR principles [@doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18], we can say with hindsight that the initial RO approaches strongly targeted _Interoperability_, with a particular focus on the reproducibility of _in-silico experiments_ involving computational workflows and the reuse of existing RDF vocabularies. 

The first implementation of Research Objects for sharing workflows in myExperiment [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkq429] was based on RDF ontologies [@newman2009], building on Dublin Core, FOAF, SIOC, Creative Commons and OAI-ORE to form myExperiment ontologies for describing social networking, attribution and credit, annotations, aggregation packs, experiments, view statistics, contributions, and workflow components [@myExperimentOntology2009].

This initially workflow-centric approach was further formalized as the Wf4Ever Research Object Model [@doi:10.1016/j.websem.2015.01.003], which is a general-purpose research artefact description framework, based on existing ontologies (FOAF, Dublin Core Terms, OAI-ORE and AO/OAC precursors to the W3C Web Annotation Model [@doi:10.1109/MIC.2013.123]), adding specializations for workflow models and executions based on W3C PROV-O [@PROVO]. The Research Object statements are saved in a _manifest_ (the OAI-ORE _resource map_), with additional annotation resources containing user-provided details such as title and description.

We can claim that one barrier for adoption of the Wf4Eer Research Object model for general packaging digital research artefacts was exactly this re-use of multiple existing vocabularies (FAIR principle I2: _Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles_), itself a challenge [@doi:10.3233/978-1-61499-660-6-9], as developers had to navigate documentation of multiple overlapping ontologies in addition to facing the usual Semantic Web choices for RDF serialization formats, identifier minting and publishing resources on the Web.

Several later developments for Research Objects improved on this situation, such as ROHub used by Earth Sciences [@doi:10.1016/j.future.2019.03.046], which provides a interactive user-interface for making research objects, along with Research Object Bundle [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.12586] (RO Bundle), which is a ZIP-archive embedding data files and a JSON-LD serialization of the manifest has mapping for a limited set of terms and was used for storing workflow run provenance (TavernaPROV [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.51314]).

RO-Bundle evolved to [Research Object BagIt archives](https://w3id.org/ro/bagit), a variant of RO Bundle as a BagIt archive [@doi:10.17487/rfc8493], used by Big Data Bags [@doi:10.1109/BigData.2016.7840618], CWLProv [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giz095] and WholeTale [@doi:10.3233/APC200107].  



## FAIR Digital Objects

FAIR Digital Objects (FDO) [@doi:10.3390/publications8020021] have been proposed as a conceptual framework for making digital resources available in a Digital Objects (DO) architecture that encourages active use of the objects and their metadata. In particular, an FDO has five parts: (i) The FDO _content_, bit sequences stored in an accessible repository; (ii) a _Persistent Identifier_ (PID) such as a DOI that identifies the FDO and can resolve these parts; (iii) Associated rich _metadata_, as separate FDOs; (iv) Type definitions, also separate FDOs; (v) Associated _operations_ for the given types. A Digital Object typed as a Collection aggregates other DOs by reference.

As an "[abstract protocol](https://www.dona.net/sites/default/files/2018-11/DOIPv2Spec_1.pdf)", DOs could be implemented in multiple ways. One suggested implementation is the [FAIR Digital Object Framework](https://fairdigitalobjectframework.org/), based on HTTP and the Linked Data Principles. While there is agreement on using PIDs based on DOIs, consensus on how to represent common metadata, core types and collections as FDOs has not yet been reached. We argue that RO-Crate can play an important role for FDOs:

1. By providing a predictable and extensible serialisation of structured metadata.
2. By formalising how to aggregate digital objects as collections (and adding their context).
3. By providing a natural Metadata FDO in the form of the RO-Crate Metadata File.
4. By being based on Linked Data and schema.org vocabulary, meaning that PIDs already exist for common types and properties.

At the same time, it is clear that the goal of FDO is broader than that of RO-Crate; namely, FDOs are active objects with distributed operations, and add further constraints such as PIDs for every element. These features improve FAIR features of digital objects and are also useful for RO-Crate, but they also severely restrict the infrastructure that needs to be implemented and maintained in order for FDOs to remain available. RO-Crate, on the other hand, is more flexible: it can minimally be used within any file system structure, or ideally exposed through a range of Web-based scenarios. A _FAIR profile of RO-Crate_ (e.g. enforcing PID usage) will fit well within a FAIR Digital Object ecosystem.


## Packaging Workflows

The use of computational workflows, typically combining a chain of open source tools in an analytical pipeline, has gained prominence, in particular in the life sciences. Workflows may have initially been used to improve computational scalability, but they also assist in making computed data results FAIR [@doi:10.1162/dint_a_00033], for instance by improving reproducibility [@doi:10.1016/j.future.2017.01.012], but also because programmatic data usage help propagate their metadata and provenance [@doi:10.1002/cpe.1228]. At the same time, workflows raise additional FAIR challenges, since they can be considered important research artefacts themselves, posing the problem of capturing and explaining the computational methods behind the analysis they perform [@doi:10.3233/DS-190026].

Even when researchers follow current best practices for workflow reproducibility, [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2018.03.014] [@doi:10.1016/j.future.2017.01.012] the communication of outcomes through traditional academic publishing routes relying on a textual representation adds barriers that hinder reproducibility and FAIR use of the knowledge previously captured in the workflow.

As a real-life example, let us look at a metagenomics article [@doi:10.1038/s41586-019-0965-1] where the authors have gone to extraordinary efforts to document the individual tools that have been reused, including their citations, versions, settings, parameters and combinations. The _Methods_ section is 2 pages in tight double-columns with 24 additional references, supported by the availability of data on an FTP server (60 GB) [@ebi_ftp_umgs2019] and of open source code in GitHub [Finn-Lab/MGS-gut](https://github.com/Finn-Lab/MGS-gut) [@finn-lab-mgsgut], including the pipeline as shell scripts and associated analysis scripts in R and Python.

This attention to reporting detail for computational workflows is unfortunately not yet the norm, and although bioinformatics journals have strong _data availability_ requirements, they frequently do not require authors to include or cite _software, scripts and pipelines_ used for analysing and producing results [@soilandreyes_tweet_2020] – rather, authors might be penalised for doing so [cite?] as it would detrimentally count against arbitrary limits on number of pages and references.

However detailed this additional information might be, another researcher who wants to reuse a particular computational method may first want to assess if the described tool or workflow is Re-runnable (executable at all), Repeatable (same results for original inputs on same platform), Reproducible (same results for original inputs with different platform or newer tools) and ultimately Reusable (similar results for different input data), Repurposable (reusing parts of the method for making a new method) or Replicable (rewriting the workflow following the method description). [@doi:10.3389/fninf.2017.00069][@goble_presentation_2016]

Following the textual description alone, researchers would be forced to jump straight to evaluate "Replicable" by rewriting the pipeline from scratch. This can be expensive and error-prone. They would firstly need to install all the software dependencies and download reference datasets. This can be a daunting task in and of itself, which may have to be repeated multiple times as workflows typically are developed at small scale on desktop computers, scaled up to local clusters, and potentially put into production using cloud instances, each of which will have different requirements for software installations.

In recent years the situation has been greatly improved by software packaging and container technologies like Docker and Conda, which have seen increased adoption in life sciences [@doi:10.1007/s41019-017-0050-4] thanks to collaborative efforts such as BioConda [@doi:10.1038/s41592-018-0046-7] and BioContainers [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btx192], and support by Linux distributions (e.g. Debian Med [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-11-S12-S5]). As of May 2021, more than 7000 software packages are available [in BioConda alone] (https://anaconda.org/bioconda/), and 9000 containers [in BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro/#/registry). Docker and Conda have gained integration in workflow systems such as Snakemake [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts480], Galaxy [@doi:10.1093/nar/gky379] and Nextflow [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3820], meaning a downloaded workflow definition can now be executed on a "blank" machine (except for the workflow engine) with the underlying analytical tools installed on demand – but even here there is a reproducibility challenge, for instance [Docker Hub's retention policy will expire container images after 6 months](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hub-image-retention-policy-delayed-and-subscription-updates/), or lack of recording versions of transitive dependencies of Conda packages could cause incompatibilities if the packages are subsequently updated. Except for brief metadata in their repositories, these containers and packages do not capture any semantic relationships of their content – rather their opaqueness and wrapping of arbitrary binary tools makes such relationships harder to find.

From this we see that computational workflows are themselves complex digital objects that needs to be recorded not just as files, but in the context of their execution environment, dependencies and analytical purpose in research – as well as other metadata (e.g. version, license, attribution and identifiers).
