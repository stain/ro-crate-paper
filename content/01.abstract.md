RO-Crate is a lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata, established through an open community-based effort. Based on schema.org annotations in JSON-LD, RO-Crate aims to make best-practice in formal metadata description accessible and practical for use in a wide variety of situations. 

An RO-Crate is a structured archive of all the items that contributed to the research outcome, including their identifiers, provenance, relations and annotations. As a general purpose packaging framework for data and their metadata, RO-Crate is used across multiple areas, including bioinformatics, digital humanities and regulatory submissions. By applying "just enough" Linked Data standards, RO-Crate simplifies the process of making research outputs FAIR.
