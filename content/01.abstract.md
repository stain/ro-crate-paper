RO-Crate is an open, community-driven, and lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata . Based on schema.org annotations in JSON-LD, RO-Crate aims to establish best-practice for formal metadata description accessible and practical for use in a wide variety of situations. 

An RO-Crate is a structured archive of all the items that contributed to a research outcome, including their identifiers, provenance, relations and annotations. As a general purpose packaging framework for data and their metadata, RO-Crate is used across multiple areas, including bioinformatics, digital humanities and regulatory submissions. By applying "just enough" Linked Data standards, RO-Crate simplifies the process of making research outputs FAIR.
