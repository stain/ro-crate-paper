### Linked Data as a foundation

The **Linked Data** principles [@doi:10.4018/978-1-60960-593-3.ch008] (use of IRIs[^1] to identify resources (i.e. artefacts), resolvable via HTTP, enriched with metadata and linked to each other) are core to RO-Crate; therefore IRIs are used to identify an RO-Crate, its constituent parts and metadata descriptions, and the properties and classes used in the metadata. 

RO-Crates are _self-described_; and follow the Linked Data principles to describe all of their resources in both human and machine readable manner.  Hence, resources are identified using global identifiers where possible; and relationships between two resources are defined with links.

The foundation of Linked Data and shared vocabularies also means multiple RO-Crates and other Linked Data resources can be indexed, combined, queried or transformed using existing Semantic Web technologies such as [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview) and knowledge graph triple stores.

Even though an RO-Crate is not required to be published on the Web, this use of mature web technologies means its developers and consumers are not restricted to the Research Object aspects that have already been specified by the RO-Crate community, but can extend and integrate in multiple standardized ways. 

[^1]: IRIs[@doi:10.17487/rfc3987] are a generalisation of URIs (which include well-known http/https URLs), permitting international Unicode characters without `%`-encoding, commonly used on the browser address bar and in HTML5.
