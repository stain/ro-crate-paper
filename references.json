    "abstract": "Information integration and workflow technologies for data analysis have always been major fields of investigation in bioinformatics. A range of popular workflow suites are available to support analyses in computational biology. Commercial providers tend to offer prepared applications remote to their clients. However, for most academic environments with local expertise, novel data collection techniques or novel data analysis, it is essential to have all the flexibility of open-source tools and open-source workflow descriptions. Workflows in data-driven science such as computational biology have considerably gained in complexity. New tools or new releases with additional features arrive at an enormous pace, and new reference data or concepts for quality control are emerging. A well-abstracted workflow and the exchange of the same across work groups have an enormous impact on the efficiency of research and the further development of the field. High-throughput sequencing adds to the avalanche of data available in the field; efficient computation and, in particular, parallel execution motivate the transition from traditional scripts and Makefiles to workflows. We here review the extant software development and distribution model with a focus on the role of integration testing and discuss the effect of common workflow language on distributions of open-source scientific software to swiftly and reliably provide the tools demanded for the execution of such formally described workflows. It is contended that, alleviated from technical differences for the execution on local machines, clusters or the cloud, communities also gain the technical means to test workflow-driven interaction across several software packages.",

    "abstract": "Many areas of research suffer from poor reproducibility, particularly in computationally intensive domains where results rely on a series of complex methodological decisions that are not well captured by traditional publication approaches. Various guidelines have emerged for achieving reproducibility, but implementation of these practices remains difficult due to the challenge of assembling software tools plus associated libraries, connecting tools together into pipelines, and specifying parameters. Here, we discuss a suite of cutting-edge technologies that make computational reproducibility not just possible, but practical in both time and effort. This suite combines three well-tested components-a system for building highly portable packages of bioinformatics software, containerization and virtualization technologies for isolating reusable execution environments for these packages, and workflow systems that automatically orchestrate the composition of these packages for entire pipelines-to achieve an unprecedented level of computational reproducibility. We also provide a practical implementation and five recommendations to help set a typical researcher on the path to performing data analyses reproducibly. Copyright ©2018 Elsevier Inc.

Faced with the complexity of analysis pipelines, the large number of computational tools, and the enormous amount of data to manage, there is compelling evidence that many if not most scientific discoveries will not stand the test of time: increasing the reproducibility of computed results is of paramount importance. The objective we set out in this paper is to place scientific workflows in the context of reproducibility. To do so, we define several kinds of repro-ducibility that can be reached when scientific workflows are used to perform experiments. We characterize and define the criteria that need to be catered for by reproducibility-friendly scientific workflow systems, and use such criteria to place several representative and widely used workflow systems and companion tools within such a framework. We also discuss the remaining challenges posed by reproducible scientific workflows in the life sciences. Our study was guided by three use cases from the life science domain involving in silico experiments.",

We have little empirical insight into what makes a dataset more reusable than others and which of the existing guidelines and frameworks, if any, make a difference. In this paper, we explore potential reuse features through a literature review and present a case study on datasets on GitHub, a popular open platform for sharing code and data. We describe a corpus of more than 1.4 million data files, from over 65,000 repositories. Using GitHub’s engagement metrics as proxies for dataset reuse, we relate them to reuse features from the literature and devise an initial model, using deep neural networks, to predict a dataset’s reusability. This demonstrates the practical gap between principles and actionable insights that allow data publishers and tools designers to implement functionalities that provably facilitate reuse. ©2020 The Authors.",

    "abstract": "Scientific workflows are a popular mechanism for specifying and automating data-driven in silico experiments. A significant aspect of their value lies in their potential to be reused. Once shared, workflows become useful building blocks that can be combined or modified for developing new experiments. However, previous studies have shown that storing workflow specifications alone is not sufficient to ensure that they can be successfully reused, without being able to understand what the workflows aim to achieve or to re-enact them. To gain an understanding of the workflow, and how it may be used and repurposed for their needs, scientists require access to additional resources such as annotations describing the workflow, datasets used and produced by the workflow, and provenance traces recording workflow executions.In this article, we present a novel approach to the preservation of scientific workflows through the application of research objects-aggregations of data and metadata that enrich the workflow specifications. Our approach is realised as a suite of ontologies that support the creation of workflow-centric research objects. Their design was guided by requirements elicited from previous empirical analyses of workflow decay and repair. The ontologies developed make use of and extend existing well known ontologies, namely the Object Reuse and Exchange (ORE) vocabulary, the Annotation Ontology (AO) and the W3C PROV ontology (PROVO). We illustrate the application of the ontologies for building Workflow Research Objects with a case-study that investigates Huntington’s disease, performed in collaboration with a team from the Leiden University Medial Centre (HG-LUMC). Finally we present a number of tools developed for creating and managing workflow-centric research objects.",

    "abstract": "The composition of the human gut microbiota is linked to health and disease, but knowledge of individual microbial species is needed to decipher their biological roles. Despite extensive culturing and sequencing efforts, the complete bacterial repertoire of the human gut microbiota remains undefined. Here we identify 1,952 uncultured candidate bacterial species by reconstructing 92,143 metagenome-assembled genomes from 11,850 human gut microbiomes. These uncultured genomes substantially expand the known species repertoire of the collective human gut microbiota, with a 281% increase in phylogenetic diversity. Although the newly identified species are less prevalent in well-studied populations compared to reference isolate genomes, they improve classification of understudied African and South American samples by more than 200%. These candidate species encode hundreds of newly identified biosynthetic gene clusters and possess a distinctive functional capacity that might explain their elusive nature. Our work expands the known diversity of uncultured gut bacteria, which provides unprecedented resolution for taxonomic and functional characterization of the intestinal microbiota.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders-representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers-have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.",

    "abstract": "myExperiment (http://www.myexperiment.org) is an online research environment that supports the social sharing of bioinformatics workflows. These workflows are procedures consisting of a series of computational tasks using web services, which may be performed on data from its retrieval, integration and analysis, to the visualization of the results. As a public repository of workflows, myExperiment allows anybody to discover those that are relevant to their research, which can then be reused and repurposed to their specific requirements. Conversely, developers can submit their workflows to myExperiment and enable them to be shared in a secure manner. Since its release in 2007, myExperiment currently has over 3500 registered users and contains more than 1000 workflows. The social aspect to the sharing of these workflows is facilitated by registered users forming virtual communities bound together by a common interest or research project. Contributors of workflows can build their reputation within these communities by receiving feedback and credit from individuals who reuse their work. Further documentation about myExperiment including its REST web service is available from http://wiki.myexperiment.org. Feedback and requests for support can be sent to bugs\\@myexperiment.org.",

    "abstract": "Computational workflows describe the complex multi-step methods that are used for data collection, data preparation, analytics, predictive modelling, and simulation that lead to new data products. They can inherently contribute to the FAIR data principles: by processing data according to established metadata; by creating metadata themselves during the processing of data; and by tracking and recording data provenance. These properties aid data quality assessment and contribute to secondary data usage. Moreover, workflows are digital objects in their own right. This paper argues that FAIR principles for workflows need to address their specific nature in terms of their composition of executable software steps, their provenance, and their development.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Open Source movement and its technologies are popular in the bioinformatics community because they provide freely available tools and resources for research. In order to feed the steady demand for updates on software and associated data, a service infrastructure is required for sharing and providing these tools to heterogeneous computing environments. RESULTS: The Debian Med initiative provides ready and coherent software packages for medical informatics and bioinformatics. These packages can be used together in Taverna workflows via the UseCase plugin to manage execution on local or remote machines. If such packages are available in cloud computing environments, the underlying hardware and the analysis pipelines can be shared along with the software. CONCLUSIONS: Debian Med closes the gap between developers and users. It provides a simple method for offering new releases of software and data resources, thus provisioning a local infrastructure for computational biology. For geographically distributed teams it can ensure they are working on the same versions of tools, in the same conditions. This contributes to the world-wide networking of researchers.",

    "abstract": "A personalized approach based on a patient’s or pathogen’s unique genomic sequence is the foundation of precision medicine. Genomic findings must be robust and reproducible, and experimental data capture should adhere to findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) guiding principles. Moreover, effective precision medicine requires standardized reporting that extends beyond wet-lab procedures to computational methods. The BioCompute framework (https://w3id.org/biocompute/1.3.0) enables standardized reporting of genomic sequence data provenance, including provenance domain, usability domain, execution domain, verification kit, and error domain. This framework facilitates communication and promotes interoperability. Bioinformatics computation instances that employ the BioCompute framework are easily relayed, repeated if needed, and compared by scientists, regulators, test developers, and clinicians. Easing the burden of performing the aforementioned tasks greatly extends the range of practical application. Large clinical trials, precision medicine, and regulatory submissions require a set of agreed upon standards that ensures efficient communication and documentation of genomic analyses. The BioCompute paradigm and the resulting BioCompute Objects (BCOs) offer that standard and are freely accessible as a GitHub organization (https://github.com/biocompute-objects) following the \"Open-Stand.org principles for collaborative open standards development.\" With high-throughput sequencing (HTS) studies communicated using a BCO, regulatory agencies (e.g., Food and Drug Administration \\[FDA\\]), diagnostic test developers, researchers, and clinicians can expand collaboration to drive innovation in precision medicine, potentially decreasing the time and cost associated with next-generation sequencing workflow exchange, reporting, and regulatory reviews.",

    "abstract": "Scientific code is different from production software. Scientific code, by producing results that are then analyzed and interpreted, participates in the elaboration of scientific conclusions. This imposes specific constraints on the code that are often overlooked in practice. We articulate, with a small example, five characteristics that a scientific code in computational science should possess: re-runnable, repeatable, reproducible, reusable, and replicable. The code should be executable (re-runnable) and produce the same result more than once (repeatable); it should allow an investigator to reobtain the published results (reproducible) while being easy to use, understand and modify (reusable), and it should act as an available reference for any ambiguity in the algorithmic descriptions of the article (replicable).",

    "abstract": "Data science is facing the following major challenges: (1) developing scalable cross-disciplinary capabilities, (2) dealing with the increasing data volumes and their inherent complexity, (3) building tools that help to build trust, (4) creating mechanisms to efficiently operate in the domain of scientific assertions, (5) turning data into actionable knowledge units and (6) promoting data interoperability. As a way to overcome these challenges, we further develop the proposals by early Internet pioneers for Digital Objects as encapsulations of data and metadata made accessible by persistent identifiers. In the past decade, this concept was revisited by various groups within the Research Data Alliance and put in the context of the FAIR Guiding Principles for findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable data. The basic components of a FAIR Digital Object (FDO) as a self-contained, typed, machine-actionable data package are explained. A survey of use cases has indicated the growing interest of research communities in FDO solutions. We conclude that the FDO concept has the potential to act as the interoperable federative core of a hyperinfrastructure initiative such as the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).",

    "abstract": "A Research Object (RO) provides a machine-readable mechanism to communicate the diverse set of digital and real-world resources that contribute to an item of research. The aim of an RO is to evolve from traditional academic publication as a static PDF, to rather provide a complete and structured archive of the items (such as people, organisations, funding, equipment, software etc) that contributed to the research outcome, including their identifiers, provenance, relations and annotations. This is of particular importance as all domains of research and science are increasingly relying on computational analysis, yet we are facing a reproducibility crisis because key components are often not sufficiently tracked, archived or reported. Here we propose Research Object Crate (or RO-Crate for short), an emerging lightweight approach to packaging research data with their structured metadata, rephrasing the Research Object model as schema.org annotations to formalize a JSON-LD format that can be used independently of infrastructure, e.g. in GitHub or Zenodo archives. RO-Crate can be extended for domain-specific descriptions, aiming at a wide variety of applications and repositories to encourage FAIR sharing of reproducible datasets and analytical methods.",

    "abstract": "Web-version: https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1 This document specifies a method, known as RO-Crate (Research Object Crate), of aggregating and describing research data with associated metadata. RO-Crates can aggregate and describe any resource including files, URI-addressable resources, or use other addressing schemes to locate digital or physical data. RO-Crates can describe data in aggregate and at the individual resource level, with metadata to aid in discovery, re-use and long term management of data. Metadata includes the ability to describe the context of data and the entities involved in its production, use and reuse. For example: who created it, using which equipment, software and workflows, under what licenses can it be re-used, where was it collected, and/or where is it about. RO-Crate uses JSON-LD to to express this metadata using linked data, describing data resources as well as contextual entities such as people, organizations, software and equipment as a series of linked JSON-LD objects - using common published vocabularies, chiefly schema.org. The core of RO-Crate is a JSON-LD file, the RO-Crate Metadata File, named ro-crate-metadata.json. This file contains structured metadata about the dataset as a whole (the Root Data Entity) and, optionally, about some or all of its files. This provides a simple way to, for example, assert the authors (e.g. people, organizations) of the RO-Crate or one its files, or to capture more complex provenance for files, such as how they were created using software and equipment. While providing the formal specification for RO-Crate, this document also aims to be a practical guide for software authors to create tools for generating and consuming research data packages, with explanation by examples.",

    "abstract": "The practice of performing computational processes using workflows has taken hold in the biosciences as the discipline becomes increasingly computational. The COVID-19 pandemic has spotlighted the importance of systematic and shared analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and its data processing pipelines. This is coupled with a drive in the community towards adopting FAIR practices (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) not just for data, but also for workflows, and to improve the reproducibility of processes, both manual and computational. EOSC-Life brings together 13 of the Life Science ’ research infrastructures to create an open, digital and collaborative space for biological and medical research. The project is developing a cloud-based workflow collaboratory to drive implementation of FAIR workflows across disciplines and RI boundaries, and foster tool- focused collaborations and reuse between communities via the sharing of data analysis workflows. The collaboratory aims to provide a framework for researchers and workflow specialists to use and reuse workflows. As such it is an example of the Canonical Workflow Frameworks for Research (CWFR) vision in practice. EOSC-Life is made up of established research infrastructures ranging from biobanking and clinical trial management, through to coordinating biomedical imaging and plant phenotyping to multi-omic and systems-based data analysis. The heterogeneity of the disciplines is reflected in the diversity of their data analysis needs and practices and the variety of workflow management systems they use. Many have specialist platforms developed over years. Workflow management systems in common use include Galaxy, Snakemake, and Nextflow, and more specialist, domain-specific systems such as SCIPION. To serve the needs of this established and diverse community, EOSC-Life has developed WorkflowHub as an inclusive workflow registry, agnostic to any Workflow Management System (WfMS). WorkflowHub aims to incorporate their workflows in partnership with the WfMS, to embed the registration of workflows in the community processes, e.g. based on pre-existing workflow repositories. The registry adopts common practices, e.g.use of GitHub repositories, and supports integration with the ecosystem of tool packages, assisted by registries (bio.tools, biocontainers), and services for testing and benchmarking workflows (OpenEBench, LifeMonitor). As an umbrella registry, the Hub makes workflows Findable and Accessible by indexing workflows across workflow management systems and their native repositories, while providing rich standardized metadata. Interoperability and Reusability is supported by standardized descriptions of workflows and packaging of workflow components, developed in close collaboration with the communities. The WorkflowHub creates a place for registering and discovering libraries of workflows developed by collaborating teams, with suitable features for versioning, credit, analytics, and import/export needed to support the reuse of workflows, the development of sub-workflows as canonical steps and ultimately the identification of common patterns in the workflows. At the heart of the collaboratory is a Digital Object framework for documenting and exchanging workflows annotated with machine processable metadata produced and consumed by the participating platforms. The Digital Object framework is founded on several needs: Describing a workflow and its steps in a canonical, normalised and WfMS independent way: we use the Common Workflow Language (CWL), more specifically the Abstract CWL (non-executable) description variant to accompany the native workflow definitions. This presents the structure, composed tools and external interface in an interoperable way across workflow languages. WfMS can generate abstract CWL, already demonstrated for Galaxy, next to the ’Galaxy workflow description. This language duality is an important retention aspect of reproducibility, as the structure and metadata of the workflow can be accessed independent of its native format as CWL, even if that may no longer be executable, capturing the canonical workflow in a FAIR format. The co-presence of the native format enables direct reuse in the specific WfMS, benefitting from all its features. Metadata about a workflow and its tools using a minimal information model: we use the Bioschemas profiles Computational Tool, Computational Workflow and Formal Parameter which are discipline independent, opinionated conventions for using schema.org annotations. Bioschemas enables us to capture and publish workflow registrations and their metadata as FAIR Digital Objects. The EDAM Ontology is further used to add bioinformatics-specific metadata, such as strong typing of inputs and outputs, within both Abstract CWL and Bioschemas annotations. Organising and packaging the definitions and components of a workflow with their associated objects such as test data: we use a Workflow profile specialisation of RO-Crate, a community developed standardised approach for research output packaging with rich metadata. RO-Crate provides us the ability to package executable workflows, their components such as example and test data, abstract CWL, diagrams and their documentation. This makes workflows more readily re-usable. RO-Crate is the base unit of upload and download at the WorkflowHub. As CWFR Digital Objects of workflows, RO-Crates are activation-ready and circulated between the different services for execution and testing. Identifiers for all the components: like FAIR Digital Objects, RO-Crates can be metadata-rich bags of identifiers and can themselves be assigned permanent identifiers. This enables the full description of a computational analysis, from input data, over tools and workflows, to final results. Using these components we have built an environment that supports the Workflow Life Cycle, from abstract description, through to a specific rendering in a WfMS to its execution and the documentation of its run provenance, results and continued testing.",

Our goal is to create specifications that enable data scientists to describe analysis tools and workflows that are powerful, easy to use, portable, and support reproducibility.CWL builds on technologies such as JSON-LD and Avro for data modeling and Docker for portable runtime environments. CWL is designed to express workflows for data-intensive science, such as Bioinformatics, Medical Imaging, Chemistry, Physics, and Astronomy.This is v1.0 of the CWL tool and workflow specification, released on 2016-07-08.The specification, in HTML format, is in the draft-3/docs folder.",

    "abstract": "myExperiment describes itself as a \"Social Virtual Research Environment\" that provides the ability to share Research Objects (ROs) over a social infrastructure to facilitate actioning of research. The myExperiment Ontology is a logical representation of the data model used by this environment, allowing its data to be published in a standard RDF format, whilst providing a generic extensible framework that can be reused by similar projects. ROs are data structures designed to semantically enhance research publications by capturing and preserving the research method so that it can be reproduced in the future. This paper provides some motivation for an RO specification and briefly considers how existing domain-specifific ontologies might be integrated. It concludes by discussing the future direction of the myExperiment Ontology and how it will best support these ROs.",
