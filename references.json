    "abstract": "In the era of data-driven science, conducting computational experiments that involve analysing large datasets using heterogeneous computational clusters, is part of the everyday routine for many scientists. Moreover, to ensure the credibility of their results, it is very important for these analyses to be easily reproducible by other researchers. Although various technologies, that could facilitate the work of scientists in this direction, have been introduced in the recent years, there is still a lack of open source platforms that combine them to this end. In this work, we describe and demonstrate SCHeMa, an open-source platform that facilitates the execution and reproducibility of computational analysis on heterogeneous clusters, leveraging containerization, experiment packaging, workflow management, and machine learning technologies.",

    "abstract": "The composition of the human gut microbiota is linked to health and disease, but knowledge of individual microbial species is needed to decipher their biological roles. Despite extensive culturing and sequencing efforts, the complete bacterial repertoire of the human gut microbiota remains undefined. Here we identify 1,952 uncultured candidate bacterial species by reconstructing 92,143 metagenome-assembled genomes from 11,850 human gut microbiomes. These uncultured genomes substantially expand the known species repertoire of the collective human gut microbiota, with a 281% increase in phylogenetic diversity. Although the newly identified species are less prevalent in well-studied populations compared to reference isolate genomes, they improve classification of understudied African and South American samples by more than 200%. These candidate species encode hundreds of newly identified biosynthetic gene clusters and possess a distinctive functional capacity that might explain their elusive nature. Our work expands the known diversity of uncultured gut bacteria, which provides unprecedented resolution for taxonomic and functional characterization of the intestinal microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Separation between content and presentation has always been one of the important design aspects of the Web. Historically, however, even though most Web sites were driven off structured databases, they published their content purely in HTML. Services such as Web search, price comparison, reservation engines, etc. that operated on this content had access only to HTML. Applications requiring access to the structured data underlying these Web pages had to build custom extractors to convert plain HTML into structured data. These efforts were often laborious and the scrapers were fragile and error-prone, breaking every time a site changed its layout.",

    "abstract": "Computational workflows describe the complex multi-step methods that are used for data collection, data preparation, analytics, predictive modelling, and simulation that lead to new data products. They can inherently contribute to the FAIR data principles: by processing data according to established metadata; by creating metadata themselves during the processing of data; and by tracking and recording data provenance. These properties aid data quality assessment and contribute to secondary data usage. Moreover, workflows are digital objects in their own right. This paper argues that FAIR principles for workflows need to address their specific nature in terms of their composition of executable software steps, their provenance, and their development.",

The recent high-throughput sequencing of cancer genomes and transcriptomes has produced a big data problem that precludes many cancer biologists and oncologists from gleaning knowledge from these data regarding the nature of malignant processes and the relationship between tumor genomic profiles and treatment response. The GDC aims to democratize access to cancer genomic data and to foster the sharing of these data to promote precision medicine approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.",

    "abstract": "Data science is facing the following major challenges: (1) developing scalable cross-disciplinary capabilities, (2) dealing with the increasing data volumes and their inherent complexity, (3) building tools that help to build trust, (4) creating mechanisms to efficiently operate in the domain of scientific assertions, (5) turning data into actionable knowledge units and (6) promoting data interoperability. As a way to overcome these challenges, we further develop the proposals by early Internet pioneers for Digital Objects as encapsulations of data and metadata made accessible by persistent identifiers. In the past decade, this concept was revisited by various groups within the Research Data Alliance and put in the context of the FAIR Guiding Principles for findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable data. The basic components of a FAIR Digital Object (FDO) as a self-contained, typed, machine-actionable data package are explained. A survey of use cases has indicated the growing interest of research communities in FDO solutions. We conclude that the FDO concept has the potential to act as the interoperable federative core of a hyperinfrastructure initiative such as the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).",

In this article, the authors present the concept and technical principles of Linked Data, and situate these within the broader context of related technological developments.

    "abstract": "# Summary This tutorial aims to illustrate the process of setting up a simulation system containing a protein in complex with a ligand, step by step, using the BioExcel Building Blocks library (biobb). The particular example used is the T4 lysozyme L99A/M102Q protein (PDB code 3HTB), in complex with the 2-propylphenol small molecule (3-letter Code JZ4). Workflow engine is a jupyter notebook. It can be run in binder, following the link given, or locally. Auxiliar libraries used are: nb\\_conda_kernels, nglview, ipywidgets, os, plotly, and simpletraj. Environment can be setup using the included environment.yml file. # Parameters ## Inputs Parameters needed to configure the workflow: * **pdbCode**: PDB code of the protein-ligand complex structure (e.g. 3HTB) * **ligandCode**: Small molecule 3-letter code for the ligand structure (e.g. JZ4) * **mol\\_charge**: Charge of the small molecule, needed to add hydrogen atoms. ## Outputs Output files generated (named according to the input parameters given above): * **output\\_md\\_gro**: final structure of the MD setup protocol * **output\\_md\\_trr**: final trajectory of the MD setup protocol * **output\\_md\\_cpt**: final checkpoint file * **output\\_gppmd\\_tpr**: final tpr file * **output\\_genion\\_top\\_zip**: final topology of the MD system",

    "abstract": "A <strong>Research Object</strong> (RO) provides a machine-readable mechanism to communicate the diverse set of digital and real-world resources that contribute to an item of research. The aim of an RO is to evolve from traditional academic publication as a static PDF, to rather provide a complete and structured archive of the items (such as people, organisations, funding, equipment, software etc) that contributed to the research outcome, including their identifiers, provenance, relations and annotations. This is of particular importance as all domains of research and science are increasingly relying on computational analysis, yet we are facing a reproducibility crisis because key components are often not sufficiently tracked, archived or reported. Here we propose <strong>Research Object Crate</strong> (or <strong>RO-Crate</strong> for short), an emerging lightweight approach to packaging research data with their structured metadata, rephrasing the Research Object model as schema.org annotations to formalize a JSON-LD format that can be used independently of infrastructure, e.g. in GitHub or Zenodo archives. RO-Crate can be extended for domain-specific descriptions, aiming at a wide variety of applications and repositories to encourage FAIR sharing of reproducible datasets and analytical methods.",

    "abstract": "<strong>Web-version:</strong> https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1 This document specifies a method, known as <em>RO-Crate</em> (Research Object Crate), of aggregating and describing research data with associated metadata. RO-Crates can aggregate and describe any resource including files, URI-addressable resources, or use other addressing schemes to locate digital or physical data. RO-Crates can describe data in aggregate and at the individual resource level, with metadata to aid in discovery, re-use and long term management of data. Metadata includes the ability to describe the context of data and the entities involved in its production, use and reuse. For example: who created it, using which equipment, software and workflows, under what licenses can it be re-used, where was it collected, and/or where is it <em>about</em>. RO-Crate uses JSON-LD to to express this metadata using linked data, describing data resources as well as contextual entities such as people, organizations, software and equipment as a series of linked JSON-LD objects - using common published vocabularies, chiefly schema.org. The core of RO-Crate is a JSON-LD file, the <em>RO-Crate Metadata File</em>, named <code>ro-crate-metadata.json</code>. This file contains structured metadata about the dataset as a whole (the <em>Root Data Entity</em>) and, optionally, about some or all of its files. This provides a simple way to, for example, assert the authors (e.g. people, organizations) of the RO-Crate or one its files, or to capture more complex provenance for files, such as how they were created using software and equipment. While providing the formal specification for RO-Crate, this document also aims to be a practical guide for software authors to create tools for generating and consuming research data packages, with explanation by examples.",

    "abstract": "The practice of performing computational processes using workflows has taken hold in the biosciences as the discipline becomes increasingly computational. The COVID-19 pandemic has spotlighted the importance of systematic and shared analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and its data processing pipelines. This is coupled with a drive in the community towards adopting FAIR practices (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) not just for data, but also for workflows, and to improve the reproducibility of processes, both manual and computational. EOSC-Life brings together 13 of the Life Science ‘ESFRI’ research infrastructures to create an open, digital and collaborative space for biological and medical research. The project is developing a cloud-based <strong>workflow collaboratory </strong>to drive implementation of FAIR workflows across disciplines and RI boundaries, and foster tool- focused collaborations and reuse between communities via the sharing of data analysis workflows. The collaboratory aims to provide a framework for researchers and workflow specialists to use and reuse workflows. As such it is an example of the <em>Canonical Workflow Frameworks for Research</em> (<strong>CWFR</strong>) vision in practice. EOSC-Life is made up of established research infrastructures ranging from biobanking and clinical trial management, through to coordinating biomedical imaging and plant phenotyping to multi-omic and systems-based data analysis. The heterogeneity of the disciplines is reflected in the diversity of their data analysis needs and practices and the variety of workflow management systems they use. Many have specialist platforms developed over years. Workflow management systems in common use include Galaxy, Snakemake, and Nextflow, and more specialist, domain-specific systems such as SCIPION. To serve the needs of this established and diverse community, EOSC-Life has developed <strong>WorkflowHub</strong> as an inclusive workflow registry, agnostic to any <em>Workflow Management System </em>(<strong>WfMS</strong>). WorkflowHub aims to incorporate their workflows in partnership with the WfMS, to embed the registration of workflows in the community processes, e.g. based on pre-existing workflow repositories. The registry adopts common practices, e.g.use of GitHub repositories, and supports integration with the ecosystem of tool packages, assisted by registries (bio.tools, biocontainers), and services for testing and benchmarking workflows (OpenEBench, LifeMonitor). As an umbrella registry, the Hub makes workflows Findable and Accessible by indexing workflows across workflow management systems and their native repositories, while providing rich standardized metadata. Interoperability and Reusability is supported by standardized descriptions of workflows and packaging of workflow components, developed in close collaboration with the communities. The WorkflowHub creates a place for registering and discovering libraries of workflows developed by collaborating teams, with suitable features for versioning, credit, analytics, and import/export needed to support the reuse of workflows, the development of sub-workflows as canonical steps and ultimately the identification of common patterns in the workflows. At the heart of the collaboratory is a Digital Object framework for documenting and exchanging workflows annotated with machine processable metadata produced and consumed by the participating platforms. The Digital Object framework is founded on several needs: <em>Describing a workflow and its steps in a canonical, normalised and WfMS independent way</em>: we use the <strong>Common Workflow Language (CWL)</strong>, more specifically the <em>Abstract CWL </em>(non-executable) description variant to accompany the native workflow definitions. This presents the structure, composed tools and external interface in an interoperable way across workflow languages. WfMS can generate abstract CWL, already demonstrated for Galaxy, next to the ‘native’ Galaxy workflow description. This language duality is an important retention aspect of <em>reproducibility</em>, as the structure and metadata of the workflow can be accessed independent of its native format as CWL, even if that may no longer be executable, capturing the <em>canonical workflow </em>in a FAIR format. The co-presence of the native format enables direct reuse in the specific WfMS, benefitting from all its features. <em>Metadata about a workflow and its tools using a minimal information model: </em>we use the <strong>Bioschemas </strong>profiles Computational Tool, Computational Workflow and Formal Parameter which are discipline independent, opinionated conventions for using schema.org annotations. Bioschemas enables us to capture and publish workflow registrations and their metadata as FAIR Digital Objects. The EDAM Ontology is further used to add bioinformatics-specific metadata, such as strong typing of inputs and outputs, within both Abstract CWL and Bioschemas annotations. <em>Organising and packaging the definitions and components of a workflow </em>with their associated objects such as test data: we use a Workflow profile specialisation of <strong>RO-Crate</strong>, a community developed standardised approach for research output packaging with rich metadata. RO-Crate provides us the ability to package executable workflows, their components such as example and test data, abstract CWL, diagrams and their documentation. This makes workflows more readily re-usable. RO-Crate is the base unit of upload and download at the WorkflowHub. As CWFR Digital Objects of workflows, RO-Crates are activation-ready and circulated between the different services for execution and testing. <em>Identifiers </em>for all the components: like FAIR Digital Objects, RO-Crates can be metadata-rich bags of identifiers and can themselves be assigned permanent identifiers. This enables the full description of a computational analysis, from input data, over tools and workflows, to final results. Using these components we have built an environment that supports the Workflow Life Cycle, from abstract description, through to a specific rendering in a WfMS to its execution and the documentation of its run provenance, results and continued testing.",

    "abstract": "The original scope of task 8.3 is to develop metrics to assess the impact on reproducibility of the availability of life-science open data and workflows in the cloud. A great part of the activities within EOSC-Life is actually related to reproducibility and provides in several ways tools that will have an impact. Therefore, we decided that it would be more informative to describe such activities and to explain why and how they will have an impact on reproducibility in life sciences, instead of providing abstract metrics for such an impact. For these reasons, we changed the title of the deliverable, from “framework to assess ...” to “framework to enhance reproducibility”. First of all, we reasoned on what can be the contribution of open science to improve the reproducibility of research. Publicly sharing data, protocols, tools and computational workflows makes it possible to compare or combine the data and outcomes from different studies within a discipline as well as integrate data across scientific domains. It allows conclusions to be validated and possibly corrected as well as being reinforced by meta-analyses. Replication data and test/training data can also be used in many applications to contribute to reproducible research. Moreover, new hypotheses, different from the original aims of the study, can be explored. Data sets can be re-used to develop and test new methods, to conduct scientific and technical benchmarking activities and to support training activities. Therefore, in addition to generating more value from research investments, data sharing has the potential to increase confidence in research outcomes and increase knowledge dissemination. These benefits of open sharing have long been recognized in some fields such as bioinformatics, which has a long history of publicly sharing data with, for example, public repositories for nucleotide sequences going back 30 years and the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a repository of information about the 3D structures of proteins, nucleic acids and complex assemblies, that celebrates its 50th birthday this year. In this notion, any improvement in sharing of data, tools and workflows among scientists and across disciplines, that is the aim of EOSC-Life and the wider EOSC, will contribute to reproducible science. In addition to this general scope, several specific actions to frame transparency in the reporting of experimental protocols, data and analytical workflows warrant the reproducibility of each single object (experimental results, data or workflows) that is made available on the cloud. We will describe here the initiatives in EOSC-Life to implement existing tools for reproducibility as well as to develop new tools for its enhancement. As the final goal of EOSC-Life is to make data resources available to the wider community of life scientists, although necessarily technical in several points, this document aims at a general readership, including experimental in addition to data scientists.",

    "abstract": "The goal of the RO-Crates-and-Excel application is to provide the data model for describing data of the excel file in the form RO-Crate. The RO-Crate describes the contained objects in JSON-LD format. The resulting JOSN-LD model should be representative of the dataset contained in the excel file and should facilitate machine actionability. This was kept in mind when desinging the model, an extension to RO-Crate base model, primarily to support dataset search.",
